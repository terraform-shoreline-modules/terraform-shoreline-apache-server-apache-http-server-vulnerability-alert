### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Apache HTTP Server Vulnerability Alert.

A vulnerability in the server can potentially be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the server or the data it hosts. This incident type involves the detection of such vulnerabilities and the generation of an alert to prompt action to mitigate the risk associated with the vulnerability.

### Parameters
```shell
export PACKAGE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"

export LATEST_APACHE_HTTP_SERVER_VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Apache HTTP Server version
```shell
httpd -v
```

### Check for any suspicious activities on the server
```shell
tail -f /var/log/secure
```

### Check if Apache HTTP Server is running
```shell
systemctl status httpd
```

### Check Apache HTTP Server logs for any errors
```shell
journalctl -u httpd -b
```

### Check for any recently installed packages that may have caused the vulnerability
```shell
yum history list | grep ${PACKAGE_NAME}
```

### Check for any security updates available for Apache HTTP Server
```shell
yum check-update httpd
```

### Check Apache HTTP Server configuration file for any misconfigurations
```shell
httpd -t -f ${CONFIGURATION_FILE_PATH}
```

## Repair

### Update Apache HTTP Server to the latest version that addresses the vulnerability.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Define variables for the script

APACHE_VERSION=${LATEST_APACHE_HTTP_SERVER_VERSION}



# Stop Apache HTTP Server

sudo systemctl stop apache2



# Update the Apache HTTP Server package to the latest version

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apache2=$APACHE_VERSION



# Restart Apache HTTP Server
